        is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue
        1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. He is widely
        regarded as one of the best players in the world.Neymar won three league
        titles, three Coupe de France, and two Coupe de la Ligue,which included
        a domestic treble and being voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year in his
        debut season. With 68 goals in 108 matches for Brazil since debuting at
        age 18, Neymar is the second highest goalscorer for his national team,
        trailing only Pelé. He was a key player in Brazil's victories at the
        2011 South American Youth Championship, where he finished as leading
        goalscorer, and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, where he won the
        Golden Ball as player of the tournament. His participation in the 2014
        FIFA World Cup and 2015 Copa América was cut short by injury and a
        suspension, respectively, before captaining Brazil to their first
        Olympic gold medal in men's football at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Two
        years later, having renounced the captaincy, he featured at the 2018
